LangGraph QuickStart: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/tutorials/quickstart/  âœ…

LangGraph Glossary, useful for some terms you'll find in the docs: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/low_level/

Common workflows: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/tutorials/workflows/

Recommendation: implementing/running the workflows from "Common workflows" above to get the hang of it. The code for all of them is already there

Then, go through some of the more advanced tutorials here in the How-to Guides: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/how-tos/

Interesting ones are "How to combine control flow and state updates with Command", "How to add thread-level persistence to your graph", "How to add cross-thread persistence" and
"How to use a Postgres checkpointer for persistence", "How to manage conversation history", How to add summary of the conversation history"
